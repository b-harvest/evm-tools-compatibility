# Test Notes

This file documents all findings, edge cases, and unexpected behaviors observed during integration testing with the custom EVM chain.

Please use it to record:
- Errors or bugs encountered while using tools (e.g., Hardhat, Foundry, ethers.js)
- Compatibility issues or limitations specific to this chain
- RPC response anomalies, revert messages, or chain-specific deviations
- Workarounds or fixes applied during testing
- Questions or items that may require further investigation

The goal is to maintain a running log of tool-chain interaction outcomes to aid debugging and ensure transparency.
